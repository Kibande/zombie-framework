================================================================================


    Design goals
    ------------
        flexible, universal, structured file format
        allow file modification without having to rebuild from scratch
        rich metadata capability
        fast section data access
        content format extensibility
        support for compression & encryption via format extensions

    Logical structure
    -----------------
        The contents of a media file are made up from
            1) metadata, which are text-based key-value pairs stored
                in a special part of the file, and
            2) named sections, containing streams of data, possibly compressed
                and/or encrypted

     == Sections
        Each file can contain one or more sections. The section can contain any
        data; it's completely up to the application to handle it.
        Each section has a name. The format allows multiple sections sharing
        the same name. Section names are UTF-8 string, though for practical
        reasons it is recommended to use only alphanumeric ASCII characters
        and basic punctuation.

        Beyond these requirements, the naming of sections is mostly up to
        the application. The convention is to prefix the section name with
        a preferably unique namespace identifier followed by a full stop (.)
        to prevent future section naming conflicts. Any section name starting
        with "media." is reserved.

     == Metadata
        File metadata are key-value pairs containing non-critical information.
        It is not recommended to use the metadata section for entries longer
        than about 2^7 (128) bytes, though the actual limit is much higher.
        
        This specification defines keys for commonly stored meta-information.
        These keys are cross-application portable and therefore should be used
        whenever possible, but only for their specified purpose.
        In addition to these so-called "pre-defined" keys, custom application-
        specific keys can be used.
        The keys can contain the alphanumeric characters a-z A-Z 0-9,
        full stop (.), hyphen (-) and underscore (_); the key must start
        with a letter.
        Key comparison is case-sensitive, but it is strongly discouraged to
        use multiple keys differing only in case. The length of the key must
        be between 1 and 255 bytes, inclusive.
        
        The following pre-defined keys are recognized:
        (keys marked with ! should be always specified, though this is not
        enforced; keys marked with * should be specified if applicable)
        
            media.original_name (!)
                Original name of the asset. It is recommended to use the
                original filename. (without extension)

                example: 'character_model_0'

            media.authored_using (!)
                Signature of the application used to generate this file.
                Specified as a list of comma-separated key-value pairs
                delimited with the character '='.
                
                The following attributes are recognized:
                    name        (!) human-readable product name
                    version     (!) numerical version (e.g. '1.0.3', 'r25560')
                    vendor      (!) developer or company name
                    website
                    library         (e.g. 'Zombie Framework 2013.05')

                example: 'name=Rendering Kit Demo,version=2.0,vendor=...'

            media.authored_by
                Name of the whomever created the original file. Can contain
                multiple names separated by semicolons.

                example: 'John Doe <john.doe@company.com>;Jane Doe'

            media.copyright (*)
                Media copyright information.

                example: '2010, 2011 Company Inc.;2012 Jane Doe'

            media.license (*)
                Full name of the license covering the work when published.

            media.displayed_name
                Human-readable media name.

            media.description
                Human-readable content description.

    Limits
    ------
        Total file size:                (2^32-1) * sector size
        Sector size:                    256 .. 2^31 bytes
        Metadata entry length:          2^15-1 bytes
        Section description length:     2^15-1 bytes
        Section data length:            2^64-1 bytes
        Control block data length:      2^64-1 bytes

    On-disk structure
    -----------------
        All integers are little-endian. For all structures specified in this
        document, assume 1-byte alignment.

        The media file is partitioned into fixed-size sectors. The first sector
        is always reserved for file header (described below)

     == Blocks
        The header is followed by multiple data streams called "blocks".
        One block that is always present in a non-empty media file is the
        Section Map. Additionaly, for each section in the file, one
        additional block will be used.

        A block is further divided into spans, each consisting of one or more
        consecutive sectors.

        A sector span is defined using the following structure:
        
            struct zmfSpan_t {
                uint32_t    sect_first;
                uint32_t    sect_count;
            };  // 8 bytes

        The fields of this structure are described below:
            - 'sect_first' is the first sector allocated for this span
                (numbered from 0 which is reserved for the file header)
            - 'sect_count' is the number of sectors in this span

        A block is specified using the following structure:
        
            struct zmfBlock_t {
                uint64_t    length;
                zmfSpan_t   first_span;
            };  // 16 bytes

        The fields of this structure are described below:
            - 'length' is the total length of the stream, in bytes
            - 'first_span' is the first span allocated for this block

        If a block requires multiple spans, the last 8 bytes of every span
        except the last one is reserved for another zmfSpan_t structure pointing
        to the next span in this block.

        It is allowed to pre-allocate more sectors for a span than required for
        the actual data.

        If the length of the block is zero, both fields within 'first_span' must
        be set to 0; if the length of a block is non-zero, these fields must
        have values other than 0.

        When a section is truncated or removed, one or more spans may become
        no longer neccessary. In that case, they will be unlinked and marked
        in the Reclaimed Sectors block (see below) for re-usage.

     == File header
        The file header always starts at offset 0 in the file. It also marks
        the beginning of the first sector which is unavailable for any other
        data.

        The actual structure of the file header depends on the bitstream
        version. (the first two fields will be always present)
        For version 101h, it has the following structure:

            struct zmfHeader_t {
                uint8_t     signature[4];
                uint32_t    bitstream;
                uint32_t    sect_size;
                uint32_t    ctlsect;

                zmfBlock_t  section_map;
            };  // 32 bytes

        The first 4 fields of this structure are described below:
            - 'signature' is always set to the four ASCII characters "ZMF2",
                marking the file as a Zombie Media
            - 'bitstream' specifies the bitstream version; for version 101h,
                this is 0x0101 shifted left by 16 bits, bitwise-OR'd with 0x0A89
                (to mark the format as binary)

                Incompatible revisions of the format will use a different value
                in the higher 16 bits. Values under 100h will never be used.

            - 'sect_size' is the sector size in bytes; this number is currently
                required to be a power of 2
            - 'ctlsect' is reserved for declaring a control sector; this field
                must be set to 0
            - 'section_map' describes the Section Map block (described below)

    == Section Map block
        The Section Map block contains information about all sections
        in the file.
        Section Map entries have variable length. They always start with
        a fixed header, followed by section description. The total number
        of entries must be determined using the block length.

        The section description is a list of comma-separated key-value pairs
        delimited with the character '='.

        The following attributes are specified:
            name            section name (required); MUST always come first
            m-encryption    encryption method (reserved for future revisions)
                can contain method-specific information after ':'

        Attributes starting with 'm-' are considered mandatory. All mandatory
        attributes must be recognized by the decoder to be able to correctly
        read the section data.

        IMPORTANT: Section description is always NUL-padded to a multiple of
                    32 bytes!

        The entry header has the following structure:

            struct zmfSectionEntry_t
            {
                uint16_t    desc_len;
                uint16_t    name_crc;
                uint8_t     compression[4];
                uint64_t    data_length;

                zmfBlock_t  block;
            };  // 32 bytes
        
        The fields of this structure are described below:
            - 'desc_len' is the length of section description in bytes
                (not including padding)

                If the highest bit is set (desc_len & 0x8000), the entry has
                been invalidated and must be skipped when reading.

            - 'name_crc' is a CRC16-CCITT hash of the section name
            - 'compression' is the FourCC code of the compression method used;
                if the data is uncompressed, all four bytes must be set to 0.
                The only compression method currently allowed is using Zlib
                (using the FourCC "ZLIB")
            - 'data_length' - length of the UNCOMPRESSED data - as opposed to
                block.length (see below) which is the on-disk data length
            - 'block' describes the block allocated for this section

     == Metadata
        If present, metadata is stored in a section named "media.Metadata".
        Metadata entries have variable length. They always start with a fixed
        header, followed by UTF-8-encoded entry data, consisting of the key,
        a single space and the value. The total number of entries must be
        determined using the block length.

        IMPORTANT: The data is always NUL-padded to a multiple of 32 bytes!
        
        The entry header has the following structure:

            struct zmfMetaEntry_t
            {
                uint16_t    entrydata_len;
                uint16_t    key_crc;
            };  // 4 bytes

        The fields of this structure are described below:
            - 'entrydata_len' is the length of the entry data (in bytes),
                not including the header and padding.
                (length = key_length + 1 + value_length)

                If the highest bit is set (length & 0x8000), the entry has
                been invalidated and must be skipped when reading.

            - 'key_crc' is a CRC16-CCITT hash of the key

     == Reclaimed Sectors
        If present, the list reclaimed sectors is stored in a section named
        "media.ReclaimedSectors".
        Its purpose is to mark which parts of the file currently don't conatin
        any valid data and can be reused when creating or extending blocks.

        An entry is represented by the structure 'zmfSpan_t'. (see above)
        The number of entries must be determined from the block length.

        Every entry specifies a sector range within the file that is available
        for allocation.
        Whenever the field 'sect_first' is 0, 'sect_count' must be 0 as well
        and vice versa. In that case, this entry has been invalidated and must
        be skipped when reading.
